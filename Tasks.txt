    - Connect to internet - MQTT - DONE
    - find out how to send data to website - DONE
    - send JSON (humidity, temperature, time sent to the website ) - DONE

    - listen to JSON for new profile


 - Website
    - Bootstrap + template
    - graph with statistics - updated every minute + exact values for current temp and humidity 
    - status - ON or OFF
    - plant profile
    - accept JSON 
    - send JSON for profile



Questions:
    - how often should we send data
    - what type of history do we store on the device - this should be determined by the types of failure we want to report
    - should we have



FINAL SUBMISSION:
    - both syncronize time


DEMO TO DO:
    - test all functionality operation
    - set humidity parameters
    - make sure to get parameters from the topic
    - data frequency - 5sec
    - average sensor readings 

    - test that listening for a profile does not block other actions in the loop
