    - find out how to send data to website - DONE
    - send JSON (humidity, temperature, time sent to the website ) - DONE

    - listen to JSON for new profile


 - Website
    - Bootstrap + template
    - graph with statistics - updated every minute + exact values for current temp and humidity 
    - status - ON or OFF
    - plant profile
    - accept JSON 
    - send JSON for profile



Questions:
    - how often should we send data
    - what type of history do we store on the device - this should be determined by the types of failure we want to report
    - should we have



NIKOLAY TO DO:
    - sort out time problem
    - decide on period to send data
    - decide on period to run loop
    - write implementation for controlling humidity
    - any init data to be processed?

    - test that listening for a profile does not block other actions in the loop



    - data frequency - 5sec
